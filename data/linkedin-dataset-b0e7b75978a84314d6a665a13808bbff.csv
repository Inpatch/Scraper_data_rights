The European Commission says this law is about “protecting children.” But let’s be honest: mass surveillance of everyone’s private messages won’t stop traffickers. It will mostly weaken encryption, threaten journalists, whistleblowers, and ordinary citizens — while criminals will just move to other channels.

👉 If protecting children was really the priority, there are better solutions:
	•	Increase the budget of specialized police units, like the OCRTEH in France, which fights child trafficking and sexual exploitation every day on the field. These teams know how to dismantle networks — but they are underfunded and understaffed.
	•	Strengthen international cooperation between Europol, Interpol, and national brigades for minors. Trafficking is cross-border, and so should be the response.
	•	Support victim protection services, like child welfare and NGOs, to ensure children are rescued and protected in the long term.

💡 Real child protection means giving more tools and resources to those who actually hunt down predators — not scanning the private conversations of millions of innocent citizens.

📢 Take action: Learn more and let your voice be heard at stopchatcontrol.eu. and fightchatcontrol.eu, Contact your MEPs and parliamentarians to tell them you oppose this law.

By default, ChatGPT has “Improve the model for everyone” turned ON — meaning your chats (and even audio/video if used) may be used to train the AI.

👉 Go to Settings → Data Controls and switch it OFF if you don’t want your data used.

✅ What this means:
	•	When ON → Your content may be reviewed and used to make the AI better.
	•	When OFF → Your chats are not used to train the model.

I recommend everyone check this setting and make sure it aligns with your privacy preferences.

Big fan of Le Chat 😺 
And now… most of my AI conversations are definitely moving there. 🚀

Why? Because today Le Chat just leveled up massively:

🤯  Memories:
 Le Chat can now remember what matters. Personalized, context-aware responses that carry over time — with full control to add, edit, or delete. 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿: 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁-𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗚𝗣𝗧.

🔌  20+ New Connectors:
 A whole directory of enterprise-ready, MCP-powered integrations. From Databricks, Snowflake, GitHub, Atlassian, Asana, Box, Stripe, Zapier, Outlook… to custom connectors you can build yourself. Le Chat becomes the single surface where data, documents, and workflows converge.

🔐  Privacy-first, flexible deployment:
 Self-hosted, your cloud, or Mistral Cloud. Admins keep full control of access and permissions.

The result? Le Chat is no longer just a chat interface. It’s evolving into a connected, enterprise-ready AI workspace that learns your way of working without compromising privacy.

For me, this is a big milestone and right now my favorite option across ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini.

Everything already available on the Free plan! (more info in the comments)

7369681347650555906,7369681347650555906,"EU member states are once again discussing the introduction of Chat Control—a literal surveillance state nightmare.

Essentially, the Union would mandate every digital service provider with a chat interface, whether it's WhatsApp, Messenger, or others, to scan users' messages before they are sent. This way, countries like Denmark argue, the EU will be better positioned to combat the spread of child sexual abuse material.

It's a noble cause—but the solution is drastic overreach.

Worse still, proponents are using misleading messaging to promote it. For instance, the latest legislative proposal claims the regulation wouldn’t prohibit end-to-end encryption in messaging apps. 

As the cybersecurity expert, Ivan Makatura, tells me, that’s not technically a lie, but it’s fundamentally a bullshit argument. If messages are scanned before they’re encrypted, encryption becomes meaningless.

Chat Control could mark an unprecedented attack on privacy in Europe. It appears to be a broad assault on encryption itself, posing a serious cybersecurity threat, especially when it comes to sensitive information.

The good news? Most of the public—and digital rights activists—still have a strong gag reflex toward mass surveillance. And politicians are starting to reflect that sentiment. Finland, Czechia, and Slovakia backed away from supporting Chat Control.

The legislation still has to go through EU Council negotiations and then a vote in the European Parliament. 
There’s a good chance Chat Control will never come into effect—and that would be a welcome outcome. 
But if this story proves anything, it’s that public outcry can genuinely influence the outcome of an EU legal process. It’s a reminder of how important it is to stand up for your rights.

→ Control content based on age
→ Get notified if the system spots serious distress

→ Use ChatGPT in open spaces

→ Remind: “AI gets it wrong too”
→ If a chat feels off, tell someone
→ For anything serious, go human-first

7365781221454282752,7365781221454282752,"The latest news saw our danish Justice Minister make poor arguments for Chat Control.
Justice Minister Hummelgaard's arguments for Chat Control sound reasonable until you think about what they actually mean.

So in regard to the danish government's Chat Control Push. Let Me try to explain with simple analogies:
Hummelgaard: ""This protects children""
Reality: Imagine saying we need to install cameras in every bedroom to catch child abusers. Real predators would just go to hotels, cars, or other locations without cameras. Meanwhile, every family's privacy is destroyed. That's Chat Control for you. Criminals adapt and innocent families suffer.

Hummelgaard: ""We've found a compromise""
Reality: As I explained in a previous discussion on a post by Kaj Grønbæk, this is like installing a door in every house that police can use anytime. Politicians promise they'll only use it ""lawfully,"" but the door is still there. Others will find it too. There's no ""compromise"" on having secret doors in your home.

Hummelgaard: ""This has democratic support""
Reality: Imagine your community voting against mandatory listening devices in every home, but city council installing them anyway because ""safety experts"" overruled them. That's the kind of surveillance infrastructure the Stasi built in East Germany, though at least they didn't rebrand it as ""child protection."" Same surveillance, better marketing.

Hummelgaard: ""Law enforcement needs this""
Reality: Police solved crimes for decades by getting warrants to search specific houses. Chat Control is like demanding keys to every house ""just in case."" It's lazy policing that makes everyone less safe.

The Bottom Line:
You wouldn't accept mandatory cameras in your bedroom or government keys to your house. Why accept it for your digital life?

As a Dane, I'm ashamed our country is leading this authoritarian overreach. We're supposed to champion privacy and democracy, not destroy them.
Say no to digital doors for everyone's homes.

Everyone thinks AI = typing to a bot.

That's like thinking cars are just faster horses.

Voice AI isn't ""chatbots with sound."" It's a completely different paradigm:

Chatbots: Type -> Wait -> Read -> Type again -> Frustration
Voice AI: Speak -> Instant intelligent response -> Problem solved

We just test processed 500,000 voice interactions in 24 hours across 40 enterprise servers:
✔ 3-second average response time
✔ 17 languages supported simultaneously
✔ 99.9% uptime maintained
✔ Zero typing required

The companies building voice-first experiences will dominate.

The ones optimizing chatbots are solving yesterday's problems.

Which approach are you betting on?

Generic calls-to-action like ""Contact Us"" are often a missed opportunity. They sound like a chore and fail to tell the user what's in it for them.

Instead, try this simple but powerful swap:

❌ Vague CTA: ""Contact Us""
It's a task, not an offer.

✅ Value-Driven CTA: ""Get Your Free CRO Audit""
It's specific, valuable, and directly addresses a problem.

A specific call-to-value can significantly increase your click-through rates by clearly communicating the benefit.

What's the most effective CTA you've ever used? Share it in the comments!

Sacrificing privacy erodes personal freedom and autonomy. Privacy is essential for personal growth and independent choices, as affirmed by the European Court of Human Rights and implied in the U.S. Constitution through amendments like the Fourth and Fourteenth. 
Threats like Europe’s proposed Chat Control or the recent pressures on Telegram’s CEO, Pavel Durov—who sent a message to users yesterday—highlight the urgent need to protect this right globally. 

At the ADI Foundation, we harness advanced cryptographic technology to ensure secure, confidential transactions and data management, empowering users while safeguarding their autonomy.

Let’s be clear: governments have used “child protection” and “the war on drugs” as excuses to strip away privacy for decades. They’ve spent billions, invaded our lives, and achieved nothing—except normalizing surveillance and expanding their budgets.

Our privacy is not negotiable.

Yesterday, I explored how chatbots save time. Today, I took it a step further:
 I started designing a real estate demo bot.


Here’s what I noticed:
→ Capturing leads is only the first step.
→ The real value is in automating the follow-ups, notifications, and lead qualification.
→ Businesses spend hours on this manually. Chatbots + workflows can handle it in seconds.


No coding required - just understanding the business problem and mapping the flow.


I’m still experimenting, but every small step makes me more confident.

Average handle time. First call resolution. Customer satisfaction scores.

Sound familiar? Most contact centers obsess over these numbers. But here's the thing - focusing only on speed is backfiring.

Centers chasing faster calls actually see:
• Higher agent turnover
• Lower customer loyalty  
• More repeat calls (ouch!)

The metrics that really matter? 

✅ Agent satisfaction scores
✅ One-contact resolution rates
✅ Customer effort scores

When your agents feel supported with the right tools, everything else clicks into place naturally.

Stop watching the clock ⏰ Start measuring what moves the needle.

But the looming threats to privacy in the name of safety does not sit right with me. A bill is currently being proposed that would mandate messaging services to mass-scan images and links in communications for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). There are good intentions behind the bill, but it would effectively end true end-to-end encryption in Europe, and by way of the Brussels effect, possibly across the globe.

Digital messaging is central to how communities organize in today’s networked society. If citizens can no longer assume that their digital communications are truly private, it makes it easier for future authoritarian regimes to surveil and suppress dissent. While most present-day European regimes aren’t authoritarian, we all know that can change.

I don't normally comment on individual pieces of regulation, but I find that the proposed bill risks eroding citizens' fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy. As such, I think it is antithetical to the ethos of European technology regulation, which has historically put its citizens’ rights to the center.

 ➡️ Weaponized documents aimed at the inboxes of high-level officials.

7370511056168787969,7370511056168787969,"Ever wondered if your encrypted group chats are truly secure? 

A recent analysis of WhatsApp's group messaging has thrown up some surprising findings. Despite WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption claims, researchers discovered that controlling or hacking the messenger platform could potentially allow access to group chats.

The research team gave WhatsApp a clean bill of health overall, confirming that it works securely and as described. However, they highlighted a crucial exception - WhatsApp provides no cryptographic management for group messages.

This means that if someone gains control of the platform, they could potentially access group chats. It's a concerning thought, especially given the recent incident where a journalist was accidentally added to a sensitive group chat involving senior White House officials.

To understand the implications, consider these key points:
– WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption doesn't apply to group management
– Researchers found that the platform's cryptographic protocols are sound, but lack group chat controls
– The potential risks are significant, especially for sensitive or high-stakes conversations

The takeaway is that while WhatsApp is generally secure, users should be aware of the potential risks associated with group chats. As we increasingly rely on messaging apps for sensitive discussions, it's essential to understand their limitations.

By being informed, we can take steps to mitigate potential risks and use these platforms more effectively.

​I keep seeing companies fully automate their support, only to leave customers feeling frustrated. 😤 🤷‍♂️

The goal isn't 100% automation, it's smart automation. Let the bots take on the routine tasks:
• Password resets
• Order tracking  
• Basic account updates

And keep your human agents focused on the high-value stuff:
• Complex problem solving
• Empathizing with upset customers
• Building real relationships

The sweet spot? Use automation to free up your agents so they can do what they do best - actually help people.

Yvonne Aurich’s warning about the EU’s proposed Chat Control law sparked 339 interactions from 134 different contributors and turned her single post into a digital town hall: The responses mapped the dividing lines of public trust.

Some called it Orwell’s “1984” come alive. Others insisted freedom must remain non-negotiable. A vocal group turned its anger toward EU leadership, while skeptics pressed back against alarmism, pointing to legal and technical hurdles. And in the mix, a quieter strand of gratitude thanked her for raising the alarm.

It is not just about one law. It is about how Europe debates surveillance, liberty, and security in real time. The intensity of the discussion shows that democratic checks do not only happen in parliaments. They also happen in comment sections, where citizens weigh risks, defend principles, and confront each other with competing visions of the future. Now, get the details 👇

7370127127993688064,7370127127993688064,"🚨 WhatsApp Web Chat Lock Bypass Vulnerability🚨

I recently reported a bypass vulnerability in WhatsApp Web’s Chat Lock to Meta's Bug Bounty. Meta acknowledged it but closed it as “informative”, calling it an accepted risk.

🔒 What is Chat Lock?
Hides chats behind a secret code or biometric lock.

On Whatsapp, hidden chats disappear until the code is entered in search.
If a user forgets the code, WhatsApp forces them to clear locked chats hence deleting chat history unless restored from a backup.

This gives users the impression of strong, cryptographic privacy.

❌ The Vulnerability
Code validation bypass in browser.
With DevTools, the function can be overridden:

d(""WAWebChatLockUtils"").validateSecretCode = () => Promise.resolve(true);
Any input in the secret code part (even blank) now unlocks chats instantly.

🧪 Proof of Concept (PoC)
Video demo attached bypassing works in seconds.

🔑 Why It Matters
·      False security → Users think chats are protected, but they’re not.
·      Inverted access control → Forgetting the code = permanent loss for the user, but attackers can unlock everything.
·      Forensics blind spot → Tools treat locked chats as encrypted, but Web bypass exposes them.
·      Session hijacking risk → With stolen sessions (cookies/XSS/shared PCs), attackers can reveal, unlock, and interact with chats without the real code.

📩 Meta's Response
“This is an accepted risk… not designed to prevent against sophisticated attackers.”

🤔 Questions for the Community
1)  Should privacy features rely on cryptography & server-side checks, not just JS logic?
2)  Is this truly informative or a critical access control bypass (CWE-602)?
3) How should platforms balance usability vs. real security guarantees?

🧑‍💻 Final Thought
I share this to spark discussion, not criticism. WhatsApp is used by billions; privacy features deserve stronger protection.

👉 Would you classify this as “informative” or a critical flaw?

⚠️ Какво е “chat control”? EU CSAM proposal (“chat control”) е предложение за регламент, с който държавите от ЕС да задължават услуги за съобщения и хостинг да сканират лични комуникации и качено съдържание. Това са включително криптирани лични чат съобщения, изображения и т.н. на всеки един жител на ЕС.

❓Официалната цел е да се предотвратят случаи с насилие над деца и да се залавят престъпници по същата линия. Съобщенията ще минават през централизирана база данни, ще се сравняват с нея и при позитив ще се отбелязват. 

⚠️ За да се ""четат"" обаче, те трябва да не са криптирани, и тук идва моментът, че много услуги като WhatsApp и Signal криптират съобщения. С цел да се прескочи това, в предложението се предлагат различни мерки, включително и client-side-scanning. Това ще направи end-to-end encryption безсмислена и ще създаде куп други проблеми. 

🔐 Критиците посочват, че това може да отвори кутията на Пандора с масово следене - нещо, което вече се усеща във Великобритания с Online Safety Act. Там тяхната мярка, приета преди две години и вече в сила, действа с всичките си негативи: фалшиви позитиви, съхраняване на данни на невинни хора, политически натиск, защото дори и в Уикипедия трябва да се регистираш. Куп други рискове са налице, включително function creep (централизираните индикатори/докладване се разширяват с времето към нови видове съдържание или престъпления) и др.

💲 Доходоносен пазар за сканиращи и „age-tech“ решения: датското правителство председателства ЕС от началото на тази година, и почти незабавно започна да лобира за тези промени.

💸 Компанията на Аштън Къчър, Thorn, се спряга като голям лобист, тъй като се предлага тя да участва в управлението на инфраструктурата (всичките тези данни, събирани от жители на ЕС).  

💀 Бъдещето неусетно се превръща в антиутопия, където личните съобщения се сканират от AI и криптирането е невъзможно, защото се ползва client-side-scanning и съобщенията се ""четат"" още преди да са достигнали криптиране.  

🔴 Досега 15 страни-членки са ""за"" предложението, докато е на изчакване, включително и България! 

Тук 👉 👉 👉 https://lnkd.in/dVVs94hD можете да се запознаете с проблема и лесно да пратите съобщение на вашите представители в ЕП, че искате да гласуват ""против"". 

На фона на това, у нас почти няма отзвук. Капитал имаха вяла редакторска статия по темата с ударение върху това, че нашите представители в ЕП са напълно безполезни същества.

And most people don’t even realize it.

It’s called Chat Control or in more technical terms, client-side scanning. On the surface, it’s framed as a tool to stop horrific crimes like CSAM. But in practice, it means this:

👉 Every message you type.
👉 Every photo you take.
👉 Every video you record.

…can be scanned before you even send it. Built into your phone’s operating system. Normalized as “AI assistance.”

This isn’t just about criminals. It’s about you. It’s about me. It’s about whether we accept living in a world where private communication ceases to exist.

I stand for leaders who refuse to be trapped by their past and who choose to build a future worth inheriting. That’s why this matters: if we let fear drive us into digital lock-in, our successors will inherit a world of control instead of trust.

We’ve been told modernization means disruption. That’s a lie. True modernization means protecting what works and what matters, whether in factories or in freedoms.

⛔ Say no to Chat Control.

Write to your MP. Speak up now, before it’s too late.

Apple is reportedly developing enterprise-level AI support that goes beyond simple ChatGPT integration. While personal iPhone users can choose whether to connect Apple Intelligence to ChatGPT, corporate devices require more nuanced solutions due to security and data privacy concerns.  This move suggests Apple is aiming to provide businesses with more control and customization over their AI integrations.

What could this mean for businesses?

• Enhanced security and privacy for sensitive corporate data.
• Greater control over AI capabilities and customization options.
• Potential for seamless integration with existing enterprise workflows.
• A more tailored and efficient AI experience for specific business needs.


This development raises some interesting questions: How will Apple balance user privacy with the demands of enterprise AI?  What specific features will they offer to cater to different business needs?  And how will this impact the broader enterprise AI landscape?  Share your thoughts!

Here’s what it actually means for group chats

Admins: there’s a new Advanced Chat Privacy option

Enable it if you want tighter control over your chats

Here’s what it does:
1️⃣ Prevents automatic media saving to device galleries. Bonus: keeps your phone cleaner and your cloud backups smaller. If you really want something, you’ll have to save it manually

2️⃣ Limits AI features like summarising unread messages or using @Meta AI. READ THE DAMN MESSAGES YOURSELF and use your brain. AI is handy, but it’s re-wiring how we think

3️⃣ Stops chat exports. Rarely needed, but handy for legal or official situations. (Yes, I’ve exported a chat once for a UK Visa to prove I was in a relationship with my wife, lol.)

⚠️ What it doesn’t do: It does not give AI access to all your chats, your phone numbers, or personal info

For over two decades, instant messengers — from Yahoo & MSN to today’s WhatsApp & Messenger — have made it so easy to stay connected. Chats, groups, calls… friends, family, colleagues, even businesses — all at our fingertips. Amazing, isn’t it?

But not always. These chat groups often turn into outlets for gossip, frustrations, e-romanticising, accusations, even abuse — all without the courage of face-to-face confrontation. Easy escape, isn’t it? Write and disappear.

Millennials grew with it, Gen X adapted to it, and Gen Z was born into it.
Yet only a few people remain authentic both online and offline.

So use messenger tools wisely. Recognize deception. Choose your own level of authenticity. And stay mindful in this “easy to write & escape” world.

In the end, chats may be free, but your conduct isn’t. Be real, be wise, because authenticity is the only message that lasts.

Most applications take either of these approaches: chatbots that make you ask the right questions, or traditional GUIs with AI sprinkled on top.

Neither works for complex, real-time decision making, and not actionable.

I've been building interfaces for years - conversational ones, products that help others build them. And I see a clear evolution path that most teams are missing:
Conversational Interfaces were step one. Chat with your data, ask questions, get answers.

Dynamic interfaces are step two. The UI rebuilds itself based on context, but still follows predictable patterns.

Playgrounds come next. Experimental spaces where you can manipulate variables and see results instantly.

But the real destination is Command Centers.

Think mission control, not chat window. Multiple data streams flowing in real-time. Every action is immediately visible. Full situational awareness with the ability to intervene anywhere, anytime.

Most industries need this level of control. Especially for mission-critical day to day usecases. Making it easy to run your day to day jobs
You just need to see everything. Control everything thats in control -  Automation. Analytics. Optimization. Scale everything. 

That's exactly what we're building at Hawky - a command center built specifically for performance marketing.

It's very unfortunate that organizations doing important and difficult work would believe blindly in a techno-solutionist proposal that creates enormous risks for very little gain in effectiveness against real child abuse.

The editorial repeats the same mistake that Chat Control does not impact end-to-end encryption. The only argument supporting this claim is that it's written in the proposal. It's such an obvious contradiction that Orwell's doublethink pales in comparison: ""This ensures that the detection mechanism can access the data in its unencrypted form for effective analysis and action, without compromising the protection provided by end-to-end encryption once the data is transmitted.""

The next argument is that scanning will be ""limited"" to URLs and visual material, like it is a minor inconvenience. Well, the compromise text admits in Page 2 that text and audio are expected to be included in the future through a review clause. It's always easier to expand the scope of surveillance after the basic infrastructure is in place.

Another fallacy is that ""scanning for known assault material is not an untested tool"", which conflates widely-deployed scanning of known CSAM in cloud storage (which is easy to bypass) with largely-untested client-side scanning of all communications before they leave a device, which is bound to inundate the authorities with false positives. This is true even under high accuracy rates, just imagine what (a far-from-current) rate of 1% false positives would mean for *all* visual content exchanged daily within the EU. 

Now imagine all the vulnerable people affected by such a broad policy, including not only journalists, immigrants and dissidents when the surveillance machine is built further by authoritarian governments lurking in the EU, but also the very children the proposal is designed to protect. How many of children's pictures or sensitive images exchanged by careless teenagers will end up being inspected manually by the authorities, framing innocents by mistake?

Client-side scanning is textbook mass surveillance. The piece finishes with an evident appeal to emotion, because no one in their right mind would rationally agree that Chat Control is a reasonable and proportional idea.

If the conversation grows too long, it loses track of earlier details, leading to confusion or generic answers.

This is why prompt design is so important—making sure the AI always focuses on the right info. 

It’s also why in my AI audits, I optimize your chatbots or assistants to keep conversations clear, accurate, and cost-effective.

While my recent 5.5-hour ""AI for Java Developers"" course covers the fundamentals, this tutorial focuses on the nuances that make all the difference in production applications.

Here's what you'll learn:
✅ How to properly configure GPT-5 (spoiler: it requires a temperature of 1.0, nothing else!)
✅ Setting up different chat options for various use cases - creative writing vs factual responses vs code generation
✅ Working with parameters like temperature, presence penalty, frequency penalty, and max tokens
✅ Why one-size-fits-all configurations rarely work in real applications

The key insight? Different features in your application need different LLM behaviors. Creative storytelling needs high temperature and presence penalty, while factual queries work best with low temperature settings. Code generation benefits from stop sequences and precise token limits.

This is especially valuable for Java developers building generative AI applications who want to move beyond basic implementations to production-ready solutions.

What's your experience with fine-tuning LLM parameters? Have you found certain configurations work better for specific use cases?

I Get Hired Because I Say No.

Having worked with entrepreneurs, CEOs, and C-suite leaders for nearly 15 years, I’ve learned something important:

I don’t get hired because I’m a “yes” person.
I get hired because I’m the one brave enough to say no — and mean it.

Why?
Because my job isn’t just about schedules and to-do lists.
It’s about protecting energy.

A leader who runs on fumes isn’t going to show up well — not for the business, not for the team, and definitely not for their own families.

And that’s where I've always come in.

Here’s what no sounds like in my world:
CEO: “Do I have an hour to chat with someone? No agenda, just a chat?”
Me: No. Because your time and energy are valuable, and random chats aren’t on the priority list today.

CEO: [sends a calendar invite before checking with me] “I offered them time next week.”
Me: NO. There’s a reason I plan your schedule like a Jenga tower.

CEO: “I just set dinner with an old colleague for Thursday.”
Me: NO. It’s your anniversary. I've put together an intinerary. 

CEO: “I have a bunch of great ideas — let’s run with them all!”
Me: NO. To the Idea Parking Lot they go.

CEO: “I’ll fly in the morning of the event.”
Me: NO. Because people expect you rested and ready.

CEO: “I’ll do my 1:1s during lunch or at the gym.”
Me: NO. You need fuel, focus, and some mental space.

Here’s the thing:
Saying no isn’t about control. It’s about capacity.
It’s about creating space for you to actually be the leader your company — and your life — needs you to be.

I also had the chance to contribute to a number of projects, and I wanted to share one that I think devs would love: OpenLLM Web, a self-hosted, free, and open access AI web app.

The idea was to build something simple but meaningful: an AI app that is completely free, open source, and privacy-friendly. Unlike most apps where conversations are stored externally, with OpenLLM Web all chat history stays right in your browser.

That means users have full control over their data. No accounts, no subscriptions, no external collection. Keeping everything local is not only safer but also gives peace of mind while using AI.

We wanted to show it is possible to make AI more accessible while putting users first. Anyone can try it, explore the code, or even host their own version, more to come about this soon :))) .

🚀 Excited to share something I’ve been building:
[`whatsapp-business-rs`] https://lnkd.in/dVe679J5 — a **Rust SDK for the WhatsApp Business API**.

Why this matters:
WhatsApp is the **world’s #1 messaging platform**, used by businesses globally. But the official API is complex and painful to integrate. This crate changes that by bringing Rust’s strengths:

* ✅ **Type-safe requests & responses**
* ✅ **Batching & bulk messaging** built-in
* ✅ **Multi-tenant support** (SaaS-ready)
* ✅ **Performance and safety from Rust**

For developers, this means faster integrations, fewer bugs, and the confidence that your WhatsApp automation can scale.

Ever wondered what your PLCs talk about when you're not looking? Turns out, with protocols like #EtherCAT, #Modbus, and OPC UA, your machines are having full-blown conversations faster than your team’s group chat and with fewer emojis... lol

For example:
VFD to PLC: “Hey, I’m running at 60Hz. You good?”
PLC: “Copy that. Telling SCADA you’re behaving.”
HMI: “I’ll make it look pretty for the humans.”

Fun fact: Some modern control systems can detect faults, reroute logic, and alert maintenance before you even sip your morning coffee ☕.

Most chatbot code relies on third-party APIs and generic voices—not ideal for privacy or personal branding. I needed a way to build a fully independent AI assistant that literally spoke in my voice, not a stock one.

The setup: trained a lightweight speech-to-text and text-to-speech engine locally, fed my own recordings, and wired up real-time dialog management—all without pinging an outside API. Now, every answer sounds uniquely mine and all data stays in-house.

You don’t need to surrender control for convenience. Your agent can (and should) sound like you, work offline, and respect your privacy.

""BIRN (Balkan Investigative Reporting Network) investigated who is lobbying and who is the main driver of this controversial proposal back in 2023. As they wrote at the time, behind European Commission Commissioner Ylva Johansson and her proposal to combat online child sexual abuse (CSAM) stands a powerful and well-funded network of lobbyists and associations that, according to internal documents and statements from participants, had undue influence on policies that could change the internet as we know it.

BIRN states that in May 2022, Johansson sent a letter to the American organization Thorn , which was founded in 2012 by Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore. Thorn is developing AI tools to identify CSAM, and the proposed regulation is designed to combat the spread of this content. In the letter, Johansson invited Thorn's CEO to 'help launch the proposal'. 
...

Although registered as a non-governmental organization, Thorn sells AI tools on the market, so the US Department of Homeland Security bought licenses for $4.3 million.

...

Criticism from the Netherlands
The Dutch organization Offlimits, Europe's oldest child sexual abuse hotline, has openly warned that the EU proposal could turn child protection into a profitable business for tech companies.

- Brussels listens too much to American associations that have their own market interests - said former Offlimits director Marietje Gerkens, adding that Johansson refused to meet with them, while regularly finding time for meetings with representatives of Silicon Valley.

The scientific community is also skeptical. Cryptographer Matthew Green from Johns Hopkins points out that European encryption experts did not participate in the drafting of the proposal, although Europe has them at the world level. In 2023, Apple publicly admitted that attempting CSAM scanning on devices was technically untenable without compromising privacy. Also, research from Imperial College additionally warns that scanning technology on devices could be misused, for example for facial recognition without the user's knowledge.

The proposal is currently in the final stages of the legislative process, with a planned vote in the European Council scheduled for 14 October 2025. According to information from Fight Chat Control, 15 EU Member States support the proposal, while 9 remain undecided and three oppose (Austria, the Netherlands and Poland). The final positions of the Member States are expected to be published on 12 September 2025, and if the proposal is adopted, the next step will be trilateral negotiations between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU to finalise the text of the law. According to some estimates, final adjustments and adoption could take place in late 2025 or early 2026.""

Description:
The surge of promotional notifications and business messages on WhatsApp has transformed a once private communication platform into a noisy marketing channel, leading to a poor user experience and loss of personal connection.

The Problem:
Personal conversations are getting buried under countless messages from brands and businesses, even when attempts are made to block or mute these accounts—they simply resurface from new numbers, making it difficult to maintain a clutter-free chat environment.

Suggested Solution:
Implement a dedicated tab or toggle to separate personal chats from business and promotional messages.
Deploy automated filters to ensure promotional content is moved out of the main chat space.
Empower users with better controls to mute, block, or archive brand notifications permanently.

""A ChatGPT wrapper is like duct-taping a calculator to your dashboard and calling it a co-pilot. It might look cool, but it won’t steer the ship, navigate the storm, or understand the mission. Organizations need agentic, modular, secure, and context-aware systems—not just clever chat bubbles.""",2025-09-01 12:36:19,2025-09-08 12:36:19,1w,no,in/jude-lauria-3b3644374,Jude Lauria,CIAO @Genenis VC | Deep Learning & Foundational AI R&D | Applied Algorithmic Trading Reasearch,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQGZrnXMt8YmVA/profile-displayphoto-scale_200_200/B4DZf4Olw.GkAY-/0/1752216265315?e=1759968000&v=beta&t=0DH5nAyTOpQeFdTCRKllN8w4VRMh247XtFmmE1K0Zqg,no,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jude-lauria-3b3644374,,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366372990223114240,,1,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,,1756730179,1757334979,

A simple, well-placed CTA can turn passive readers into real leads.

Here’s how to make it work:

✔️ 𝗕𝗲 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿
Use direct phrases like “Book a demo” or “Download the guide.” Visitors should know exactly what will happen when they click.

✔️ 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀
Don’t hide your CTA at the bottom. Add it at key points. After explaining value, near the top, and repeated on long pages.

✔️ 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲
Buttons should stand out with contrasting colors and enough space around them.

✔️ 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
Each page should push one main CTA. Too many options can confuse and reduce clicks.

✔️ 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗶𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲
Your CTA should promise something useful - a solution, a resource, or the next step in their journey.

The best websites don’t just inform. They guide.

Last week our paid customers asked for a dedicated feedback channel. Within 12 hours of creating it they had:

Self organized into different discussion threads

Started tagging duplicate feature requests to avoid spam

Began filling out bug reports by searching chat history first

Used voting system using reactions to prioritize features

The most surprising part? They're doing quality control for us. New members post requests and existing users reply ""already discussed here"" with links to previous conversations.

This isn't just community management anymore. Its collaborative product development.

What really hit me was watching a customer spend their time helping another user troubleshoot an issue before escalating to our team. They knew our platform better than some of our beta testers.

The lesson here isnt about Discord specifically. Its about giving your most engaged users ownership over the feedback process.

Most founders treat feedback channels like suggestion boxes. But when you give users agency to organize and prioritize their own requests something magical happens.

They start thinking like product owners instead of complainers.

Now our roadmap planning meetings start with ""what are the Discord power users saying"" instead of ""what do we think users want.""

 Not from a teammate, but from your project dashboard itself.
Chatbots inside business tools are no longer just support assistants – they’re becoming decision-making partners. Imagine:
🔹 Asking your dashboard about project progress instead of searching through reports
 🔹 Getting instant updates on costs, timelines & resources in one chat window
 🔹 Turning complex data into simple conversations
This blend of AI + project management makes work smoother, faster, and a lot smarter.

And limiting your progress. 

Thanks to Gareth Lloyd for inspiring this post! 

As a founder, I've learned a lot about control. 

We think that we're supposed to control every outcome. 

But that's a quick route to exhaustion, 
And driving your team completelyyyyy nuts. 

The only stuff you can control is what's within you. 

You can’t control the outcome.
But you can control the effort you show up with.

You can’t control what people say about you.
But you can choose how much weight you let it carry.

You can’t undo the mistakes you’ve made.
But you can decide what you take from them.

There’s chaos everywhere in business.
Markets flip, teams change, and deadlines shift.

The people who stay grounded don't try to keep it all together. 

They just double down on what actually matters:

✅ Their reaction
✅ Their output
✅ Their standards
✅ Their time
✅ Their next move

That’s your competitive edge. 

Let go of the idea of full control. 
It's a myth. 

Focus your control on the things within your reach, 
And let the rest of it be someone else's problem.

Using the AI SDK we can create a shared chat context that allows different parts of the UI to access the same conversation without duplicating state. This pattern ensures that the chat remains consistent whether the user is typing a new message, viewing the conversation history, or resetting the session.

By setting up a provider with a shared Chat instance and connecting it to an API route for streaming responses, developers can build modular and scalable chat experiences. The result is a cleaner codebase, reusable components, and a seamless user experience.

This approach is especially useful for projects where AI interactions need to be integrated into multiple areas of the interface while maintaining continuity.

Regulations like the NIS2 Directive, the AI Act, and the EUDI Wallet all rely on secure, trustworthy cryptography to build Europe’s vision of digital sovereignty. 

Yet at the same time, the proposed Chat Control regulation risks undermining that very foundation. 

Mandating the scanning of private communications (even in encrypted apps like WhatsApp, Signal or iMessage) would create a backdoor by design.

What’s at stake is:

→ A direct conflict with the EU’s own laws
→ Fundamental rights under the EU Charter (privacy, data protection, freedom of expression)
→ Europe’s credibility as a global leader in trustworthy digital systems

This tension goes beyond one proposal. It raises a fundamental question: how can Europe ensure protection without weakening the very digital trust it has worked so hard to build?

This summer our team built Duomigo—a Tamagotchi-style iOS app where mini-games fuel vocabulary and boost your Duo’s energy bar.

My contributions:
- Built a backend spaced-repetition scheduler to time practice smartly.
- Shipped the Catch mini-game logic and interactions.
- Designed and implemented backend microservices for speed and reliability.
- Co-authored tech specs that set the blueprint.
- Created reusable classes so future-us can ship faster.

Reflections I’ll carry forward

- Git is collaboration as much as version control—clear commits and thoughtful reviews matter.
- Done well, Agile turns feedback into momentum.
- Strong tech specs align decisions early and save future engineering time.
- Shipping is great; shipping with great people is better.

Standout cultural trait: open 1:1s with anyone—learning straight from the source is easy.

Grateful for the dream squad: Angelina Reyes (best manager ever) and teammates Vanohra Gaspard, Juliano Portela, and Daniel Monroy.

Mentorship from Jasmine Turner (Kaleidoscope) was my north star.

Code-review wisdom from Gabriel Mitnick (best iOS engineer ever and a spirited advocate that Swift is the best programming languages).

Huge thanks to Jaylyn Jones and Michelle Roque Alvarez for making the journey smooth—I appreciated the check-ins and the desk fly-bys. (When Jaylyn saw me coming, she knew I had questions.)
Honorable mention to Megan Sobolosky for an intern experience packed with events and opportunities.
Bonus highlight: leadership chats with the CEO and Chief Engineering Officer—and the merch. My closet now speaks fluent green. 💚

Biggest takeaway: keep learning, and help others learn.

Thank you, Duolingo, for an unforgettable summer of growth, fun, and learning.

The move follows a wrongful death lawsuit by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who allegedly used ChatGPT as a “suicide coach.”

Stories like this are truly horrific. If these features save just one person from harm, it is worth the effort.

Coming in the next month:

🔹 Parental controls to link accounts, manage chat history, and set age-appropriate responses.

🔹 Distress detection with alerts and escalations to advanced models like GPT-5-thinking for stricter safety.

🔹 Expert council of 250+ specialists, including adolescent mental health, eating disorders, and substance use, aiding OpenAI in developing these safeguards.

This is a pivotal moment for AI safety. How do we balance open access to increasingly powerful AI while minimising the risks to vulnerable users?

Does it go far enough? Not nearly. But it is a step towards building safer systems before they become offline enabled with on-device processing.

Would I trust any of the major AI chatbots to have unmonitored conversations with my young children? Of course not. Would you?

Time will tell whether these features begin to address the problem.

I really hope they do.

Placement Matters: The placement of your CTA (Call to Action) is important. Where you place your CTA—at the top, middle, or end—determines the level of attention and clicks it receives.

Tone is Key: The tone you use can change the outcome of your CTA. The right words, like ""Get Started"" instead of ""Submit,"" can inspire action and not hesitation.

Color Influences Clicks: Color impacts clicks. Not all colors perform equally, and using contrast can help drive focus.

Always Test: You should always test and improve your CTAs. A/B testing reveals the winner, and using data beats guesswork.

A client recently shared how their bot kept looping, misunderstanding simple questions, and frustrating customers. Watching it all fail, they felt completely helpless.

AI bots can do amazing things, but when they mess up, it hurts your brand’s trust and customer experience.

Common issues:
→ Bots miss context and nuance
→ Endless back-and-forth loops
→ Frustrated customers abandon chats
→ Lost leads and damaged trust

So, how do we fix these bot struggles and make AI truly help customers, not frustrate them?

What’s the biggest challenge you’ve faced with AI bots? Share below, let’s figure this out together.

Yes, Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini are nifty tools, and when used effectively, can increase your productivity and unblock you. 

But you haven't truly leveraged AI until you start using it to make informed decisions for you. 

I'm not suggesting that we delegate all control over to this technology - far from it. 

What I am saying is there is far more to the technology than most of us realise. Once you start to integrate it into common workflows within your business, using tools like n8n or Make, you start to see that ChatGPT & the like are merely the tip of the productivity iceberg.

7368566144909160449,7368566144909160449,"📊 Control Charts Talk. Are You Listening?

In many organizations, control charts are created, updated, and filed away.
But the truth is — a control chart is more than a graph. It’s your process speaking.

👉 Here’s what it says if you listen carefully:

Within Control Limits: “I’m stable and predictable. Continue monitoring.”

Point Outside Limits: “Something unusual just happened. Investigate!”

Pattern or Trend: “I might be shifting — don’t ignore me.”

Too Much Variation: “Your process isn’t consistent. Look deeper.”

A control chart helps separate signal from noise. Instead of reacting to every small up and down, it teaches us to respond only when the process is truly calling for action.

🎯 This is why control charts are the backbone of Statistical Process Control (SPC). They prevent overreaction, reduce firefighting, and promote a culture of data-driven decision making.

So next time you see a control chart, pause for a moment.
It’s not just lines and dots… it’s your process talking.
The question is: Are you listening?

Most people won’t switch.

Why? 

Because ChatGPT is already “good enough.”

That’s the trap in consumer AI. 

Once users build habits, it takes more than better answers to make them move.

That’s why Google is playing a different game…

Not just chat.

But:

✅ Video editing with Google Vids
✅ Image generation inside Workspace
✅ Voice + productivity workflows

These aren’t just regular features,
they’re side doors into Gemini.

Each one creates a viral moment, gets users to try it and slowly shifts them into Google’s ecosystem.

The real battle isn’t “Who has the smartest model?”

It’s “Who controls the entry points where people actually spend their time?”

And right now, Google is seeding those entry points everywhere.

This functionality, previously available on iOS and Android, now allows macOS users to efficiently sort their conversations into ""Unread,"" ""Favourites,"" and ""Groups"" categories directly from the top of their chat list.

This enhancement is a substantial quality-of-life improvement for professionals and regular users alike, as it significantly streamlines conversation management. The ability to quickly isolate unread messages, prioritize key contacts, or consolidate group discussions reduces the time spent navigating a cluttered chat interface. This not only boosts user productivity but also brings the macOS experience closer to feature parity with its mobile counterparts, ensuring a consistent and robust user experience across platforms. The rollout of such features underscores WhatsApp's commitment to evolving its desktop applications to meet user demands for better organization and accessibility.

Think of a chatbot as your 24/7 event assistant, which answers guest questions, sends reminders, manages RSVPs, gives seat Info’s, and even helps with ticket sales.

It works silently in the background, so you can focus on creating memorable experiences for your guests.

First it was LLM. Then it was RAG. Now it is MCP.

Model Context Protocol fascinates me more than many other things. Because with it, chatbots built on LLM can access resources (materials, prompts, executable functions) and execute code on other systems to do the job.

The scalability bottleneck is now in the marketing team. You need to be a marketing engineer to pull it together for yourself.

How to scale it to the entire team?

I was using ChatGPT a lot for my everyday coding and brainstorming. Over time, as the chat grew longer, ChatGPT became sharper, until it started to hallucinate. I’d often think: “I wish I could start a new chat with the same history and context but avoid the drift.” Well, OpenAI just made that a reality with their “branching” feature.

Here’s how it works: simply hover over any ChatGPT message, open the three-dot menu under the reply, and select “Branch in new chat.” It creates a parallel thread from that exact point, keeping context, separating paths, and preserving the original all at once.

Why this matters:
- Safe experimentation: You can explore alternate logic or brainstorm fresh variations without disrupting your main conversation.
- Cleaner context control: No more lengthy chats bloated with irrelevant detours, each branch stays on point.
- Reduced hallucination risk: By cleanly restarting from a known state, you avoid compounding errors that snowball over long threads.

In the last two days, two family members have fallen victim. Here’s how it works:

- You get a message from a trusted contact: “𝘐 𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘴𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘢 6-𝘥𝘪𝘨𝘪𝘵 𝘤𝘰𝘥𝘦 𝘷𝘪𝘢 𝘚𝘔𝘚, 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘴𝘦𝘯𝘥 𝘪𝘵 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬?”

- Out of muscle memory, you forward the code.

- BAM! You’re locked out of WhatsApp. The hacker takes over your account, repeats the hack with your contacts, and may even request money.

To make it worse:
- WhatsApp makes you wait 12 hours to regain access.
- You can’t alert all your contacts due to messaging limits.
- Your business contacts may be targeted, putting your reputation at stake.

Key learnings:
- Never share codes on WhatsApp—train your muscle memory.

- Have a contingency plan: an alternate number or broadcast list to alert business contacts.

- Large BFSI companies/enterprises should avoid employees using personal WhatsApp for customer communication.

At Saleschat, we help mitigate these risks by empowering your team to leverage WhatsApp but with security and compliance.

The infamous .000001 second of silence before you can tell whether the prospect loves you or hates you right off the bat.

If they want to chat to you or not. 

I call this face, 'bracing myself for impact'. 😬 

You definitely can learn a couple of basics to be good at cold calling, and for sure, objection handling and confidence are probably the two things that are going to get you pretty far...

But with so many good openers out there, sometimes it HAS TO do with the person on the other end of the phone. 

I know this having tried multiple different openers with multiple different people and none sticking. 

It really is luck of the draw sometimes. 

You could have called them at the worst possible time, they're on vacation, they're on maternity leave, they've just been let go.

But I literally had a lady yesterday chat to me even though she left the company I was calling about, turns out she now works at a different company and we became besties. 💖 🙊 

I could not have predicted that and I didn't do anything different within the first 10 seconds to what I usually do.

But obviously I sounded enthusiastic, kind and eager to speak to her and learn more. 

You just sometimes can't control the other end of the line. 

So control the controllables, and 'brace for impact' with the rest. 😶‍🌫️ 🫣 ✌

We’ve all been there, using AI at “Level 1”: email drafts, quick summaries, proofreading. It’s helpful, saves time, and lets us maneuver faster with fewer people.

I even used it to organize my thoughts for this post. But here’s the question we often skip over:

👉 Are we being strategic, or just scratching the surface?
👉 Are we looking at the risks as much as the rewards?

Not every business can hire a Chief AI Officer (CAIO), but that doesn’t mean you can’t apply the same principles in your own way. Start here:

1️⃣ Clean Data – AI is only as good as what you feed it. Protect client and business data by:

▪︎Anonymizing names/emails before pasting into AI
•Turning off Chat History in ChatGPT (Settings → Data Controls) so your chats aren’t used for training
•Keeping sensitive details in-house, and only sharing patterns or summaries with AI


2️⃣ AI Guardrails – Boundaries matter. AI should never run unchecked in your business. Think about:

Access levels: Who on your team is allowed to use AI for what?

•Compliance: Make sure AI outputs align with laws in your industry (privacy, HR, financial reporting).
•Bias & brand voice: Review outputs critically, does it represent your business fairly, ethically, and in your tone?
•Decision check: AI should support decisions, not make them for you. Keep a human in the loop.


3️⃣ Clear Strategy – Without a plan, AI becomes a shiny distraction. Anchor it in outcomes:

•Revenue: Is this AI use driving sales, upsells, or new market opportunities?
•Cost savings: Does it reduce workload, eliminate duplicate systems, or improve efficiency?
•Customer experience: Is it improving response time, personalization, or service quality?
•Competitive edge: Will this use of AI differentiate you in a crowded market?

AI can either be a growth engine or a cost sink, it depends on how intentional you are.

Thank you Matthew Rottman for his article and great tips.

If you’ve seen a pen icon pop up in your WhatsApp chat bar, that’s not a bug, that’s AI showing up to help.

Meta is testing a new feature called Writing Help. When turned on in your app settings (under “Private Processing”), it replaces the sticker icon with a pen after you type something in the chat box.  

What does it do? Simple, it gives you suggestions to make your message sound better. You can choose a tone like:

- Professional (formal)

- Supportive (gentle & kind)

- Funny (lighten it up)

- Rephrase (clearer version)

- Proofread (fix grammar/spelling)

You’ll get a few versions of your message and can pick what fits or stick to your original. No one will know you used AI.

Meta says:

- It’s opt-in only

- Messages are processed privately and anonymously

- AI only sees what’s in your input box, not your full chat

So why does this matter for Chat Nation?

If you’re a citizen, this makes talking to your government easier — you can get your message right without stressing over tone or grammar.  

If you're a government, it means fewer miscommunications, clearer requests, and better service delivery, all from within WhatsApp.

And since I work with governments building WhatsApp solutions for public services, I can already see the impact this will have.

Managing group chats can be messy, too many messages, lost details, and endless scrolling. For today’s challenge, I explored how AI can enhance WhatsApp group chats to make communication smarter and more productive.

Problem

Group chats often suffer from:-

a. Information overload.

b. Lost tasks, deadlines, or key points.

c. Time wasted searching for messages.


Solution

I designed an AI assistant integration that:-

a. Summarizes long conversations into clear highlights

b. Answers questions like “When is the meeting?” directly from chat history

c. Telling you thd mood of the group 

d. Tell you if an event is been mention or planned in the group 


Impact

a. Saves time by reducing chat clutter

b. Keeps groups organized and on track

c. Makes catching up easy for late joiners


This small design experiment shows how AI can transform everyday tools into smarter, more efficient experiences.

I’m Faheem and I have been quietly building something I believe every independent cafe, bakery and roastery deservers all over the world.

Now I didn’t start JustPass to build “another loyalty app”

Apps are long.
Customers hate downloading them.
Business owners almost always lose control of their data.

So I built something different…

A digital loyalty card that sits in Apple & Google Wallet - stamp-based, logo-reveal, or fully tailored to your brand.

Branded programs you can name — like Yugo Perks or Grind & Earn.

Analytics that matter — see visit patterns, top 3 loyal customers, and real data you control.

Smart customer touch-points — send offers, birthday perks, or one daily push notification direct to their wallet.

Now what’s the result of that?
Already 400+ users have signed up across just a few cafés.

Decent right?
I’ve spoken to many café owners, and the message is always the same:

Paper cards are a headache.
Apps feel like overkill.

What they really want is loyalty without the middleman.
That’s why I’m here.

To help independent businesses keep their customers coming back.
Without giving away control to platforms.

So if you run a café, bakery, or roastery and care about retention.

I’d love to chat and for any independent business owners viewing this right now what's the loyalty system you’re using right now? 
Paper, app, or nothing at all?

Many businesses use one WhatsApp number for all customer messages.

But when many chats come in, it’s hard to manage:
– Who should reply?
– Are follow-ups happening?
– Are leads getting missed?

To fix this, we’ve added a new feature in our CRM – WhatsApp Automation.
Here’s what it can do:
All WhatsApp messages come directly into your CRM.
Chats are auto-assigned to your team members.
Your team can reply from inside the CRM.
You can track every reply and team activity

It's not working on it.

Sometimes it takes multiple attempts get it to actually initiate the task.

7369779638526578690,7369779638526578690,"Hi network, It’s been a while ;)

I’ve just wrapped up a 14-month industrial placement at J.P. Morgan Chase as a Software Engineer, and what a journey it’s been!

When I first joined, I wasn’t sure if Software Engineering was for me. I chose Computer Science relatively late and didn’t have the portfolio of side projects that many of my classmates did.

But slowly and surely, I found my rhythm. I was building real software used by real people (for real). I worked with Python and React, contributing to tools that support resiliency, controls, and testing in the firm’s largest trade management system. And if there’s one thing I’ve learnt working in an investment bank, it’s that stability is key 🔑

Supporting clients, building features, fixing bugs: I realized this is exactly what I love to do. 

Here are 3 big takeaways from my experience (and maybe something useful for you too):

1. Don’t be afraid to ask questions
Many people told me this when I started, but I thought surely I should prove my independence 🤔. However, my curiosity over time is what helped me understand the complex eco-system around me, and how my work fits into that picture, further enhancing my business results. 

2. Teamwork makes the dream work
Everyone brings something different to the table. When working on urgent production issues, the collaboration and camaraderie was essential in making those dreadful problems go away! And you learn a great deal by coding with someone else. 

3. Be yourself ✨
I was lucky to be part of a diverse and very supportive team. I didn’t have to fit into a rigid box of what I thought an intern should be. My motto: be friendly, open, curious, hardworking, and good opportunities will follow. That’s also what will make your contributions unique in every part of the process ;)

Finally, I want to say a huge thank you to Sam Raddon my manager, my amazing team, and the intern cohort: you all made this experience so special. I learned more than I ever expected, and I genuinely enjoyed every team dinner, intern social, and coffee chat ⭐️

Now it’s time to take everything I’ve learnt and smash my final year!",2025-09-06 12:38:19,2025-09-08 12:38:19,2d,no,in/saron-tewolde-035199189,Saron Tewolde,Software Engineering Intern at JP Morgan & Chase | 3rd year Computer Science Student at the University of Bath,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQHoriseHQwh-A/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/B4DZjBUpjdHwAU-/0/1755590073339?e=1759968000&v=beta&t=rRbll-LNdFK0a2v_m44Rmpwfs3uPnjqVoUTQ5fSmNSk,no,https://www.linkedin.com/in/saron-tewolde-035199189,,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369779638526578690,,14,0,109,88,4,14,0,3,0,,1757162299,1757335099,

One of the smartest ways to do this is by using chatbots on your website. These AI-powered chatbots can engage visitors instantly, answer their questions, and most importantly, capture leads without any delay. Instead of letting potential clients slip away or waiting for a human to respond, chatbots create a seamless interaction that feels personal and timely.

But it doesn't stop there. Integrating these chatbots with a CRM system automatically takes your lead management to the next level. Tools like n8n make it easy to connect your chatbot to a CRM, ensuring every lead is synced and ready for follow-up without manual data entry. This automation saves time, reduces errors, and helps your sales team focus on converting leads rather than chasing them down.

With AI advances like ChatGPT, chatbots can even personalize conversations based on visitor intent, making interactions more meaningful. Combining smart chatbots with automation tools creates a powerful funnel, turning casual visitors into loyal customers faster than ever.

Here’s a simple strategy I now use to create buttons effectively:

In the earlier stage of my UI journey, I made the mistake most newbies make creating buttons with just shapes. But over time, I’ve learnt to create buttons using a component set.

This shift ensures consistency, scalability, and efficiency, making it easier to reuse buttons across screens, saving time and keeping the UI user-friendly.

Elon Musk has ushered in the next era of messaging with XChat, a powerful new feature embedded directly into the X platform—designed to go head-to-head with WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal. Built on Rust with what Musk calls “Bitcoin-style encryption,” XChat brings enhanced privacy, versatility, and seamless communication—all without needing a phone number.

** Key Features of XChat:**

End-to-end (or “Bitcoin-style”) encryption

Disappearing (vanishing) messages and unsend options

Share any file type—images, documents, media, you name it

Audio & video calls, no phone number required

Cross-platform sync for seamless conversation across devices


This launch is another bold stride in Musk’s vision to transform X into an “everything app”, akin to China’s WeChat—combining messaging, payments, social media, and more within a unified ecosystem.

If early reports are any indication, some X Premium subscribers are already testing XChat, with wider rollout beginning this week.

Why It Matters for the Tech & Business Community:

A strong push toward super app integration, offering convenience like never before

Elevated privacy features that could reset user expectations

A strategic play in the messaging landscape—potentially shifting balances in global communication apps

— Nvidia reports $46.7B revenue, fueled by AI
 — Anthropic raises $13B at $183B valuation
 — OpenAI buys Statsig for $1.1B, Raji named CTO
 — Microsoft launches two in-house models
 — Meta reorganizes and pushes new Llama
 — xAI drops Grok Code Fast 1
 — Meta’s AI hiring spree backfires
 — Alibaba unveils domestic AI chip
 — Anthropic builds Claude Code for web
 — Mistral adds memory to Le Chat

Here’s everything you need to know:


1/ Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, reported $46.7B in revenue this quarter, up 56% YoY. AI data center sales drove the surge.

2/ Anthropic raised $13B at a $183B valuation, tripling since March. ARR jumped from $1B to $5B, with Claude Code surpassing $500M run-rate.

3/ OpenAI acquired Statsig for $1.1B, bringing in cofounder Vijay Raji as CTO of applications. The move strengthens its experimentation stack as ChatGPT scales.

4/ Microsoft unveiled two in-house models: MAI-Voice-1, generating speech in under a second, and MAI-1-preview, a MoE model trained on ~15k H100s. It’s a bid to reduce reliance on OpenAI.

5/ Meta will release Llama 4.X before year-end, its first project from the new Superintelligence Labs. The unit now splits into training, research, product, and infra.

6/ xAI launched Grok Code Fast 1, a coding model priced at $0.20 per million tokens vs $18+ from rivals. It’s free for now via GitHub Copilot and Cursor.

7/ Meta’s AI hiring spree is unraveling: ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao nearly quit days after joining, while other OpenAI recruits lasted under a month.

8/ Alibaba revealed a domestic AI inference chip under pressure from Beijing to cut Nvidia reliance. It’s still in testing.

9/ Anthropic is building a web version of Claude Code with GitHub integration and safe sandboxes. No release date yet.

10/ Mistral gave Le Chat “Memories” with transparent recall, citations, and editable logs. It’s designed for more user control.

But if your energy is off, no one’s listening.

Here’s the truth:

→ People don’t just hear your words.
→ They feel your presence.

You don’t control the mood of the entire workplace.
But you do control how people feel after interacting with you.

If you bring pressure, stress and negativity — that spreads.
If you bring calm, support and clarity — that spreads too.

Here’s how to “bring the sunshine”, regardless of the forecast:

Smile when you enter a call
↳ Simple. But powerful.

Don’t start every chat with urgency
↳ “Got a second?” > “We need to talk.”

Check in with people without needing anything
↳ “Just wanted to say hi. How are you?”

Protect your tone in emails and Slack
↳ Clarity without coldness = connection.

Be warm, even when others aren’t
↳ Kindness is a leadership decision, not a reaction.

Pressure is contagious.
So is kindness.

🔎 UI/UX Observation as a QA on iPhone 15 🔎

While exploring WhatsApp on my iPhone 15, I came across an interesting UI issue (screenshot attached).

👉 The microphone and camera icons in the chat input bar are overlapping.

At first glance, it may seem like a small glitch. But as QA professionals, we know that even minor UI inconsistencies can create:
	•	Confusion for users 🌀
	•	Accessibility challenges ♿
	•	A less polished product experience ✨

This is a reminder that Quality Assurance is not just about functionality, but also about ensuring a seamless and delightful User Experience (UX).

💡 Takeaway: Details matter. The end-user may not report it as a bug, but they feel the friction. And that’s where QA adds value!

We’re third-time founders (Saul / Wojtek), and very excited to announce we’ve raised $500K to make Jely a reality.

Jely was built out of a painful lesson which we learned from our last startup: if your user conversations leave your platform, your revenue does too. 

We lost sales to slow replies, messy channels, and users who’d rather chat to each other on WhatsApp than inside our platform.

So we decided to fix it.

👉 Jely lets your users safely connect with each other through their favourite chat apps, whilst you stay in control.

No downloads or logins for them, and one source of truth for you and your team to see every conversation.

With Jely, businesses can:
 ⚡ Stop revenue leaks with faster replies
 🔐 Keep chats safe with ID masking and mediation
 📈 Unlock hidden revenue with chat analytics

We’d like to say a huge thanks to the following angels and VCs who have made this round possible: Husayn Kassai, Imran Tehal, Ibrahim Khan, Mohsin Patel, Uzair A., Cur8 Capital, James Hole, Oliver Musial, Chung Hua, Ruhul Amin, and Ajit Kumar
 
We’ll be building in the open - sharing our hypotheses, what breaks, what actually works, and everything in between.

1. Grid-First Interface

- Run agents directly in familiar spreadsheet format
- Scale from 10 to 10,000 companies instantly
- Keep full control over every agent action
- Export results anywhere

2. Integrated Web Search

- Search and organize in one view
- No more tab switching
- Continuous crawling until you get what you need

3. Direct CRM Connection

- Pull company data from HubSpot
- Sync with Affinity
- More integrations coming

Stop forcing AI agents into chat bubbles.
Start running them in a format that actually works.
